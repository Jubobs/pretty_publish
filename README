Improves LaTeX output of MATLAB's "publish" function by performing
syntax-highlighting of m-code

Installation:
 1. Install dependencies (see below).
 2. Back up the file toolbox/matlab/codetools/private/mxdom2latex.xsl in
your local MATLAB installation;
 3. Replace toolbox/matlab/codetools/private/mxdom2latex.xsl by
the mxdom2latex.xsl file provided by pretty_publish;
 4. Test that everything works well by running

    publish('peaks','latex')

at the MATLAB command line.

Uninstallation:
 Simply replace toolbox/matlab/codetools/private/mxdom2latex.xsl by the
 backup of the original.

Additional dependencies (compared to vanilla "publish"):
 - matlab-prettifier LaTeX package (http://www.ctan.org/pkg/matlab-prettifier)
